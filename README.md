As a skilled programmer with a strong background in various programming languages, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to effectively design and develop high-quality software solutions. I have a keen eye for detail and a passion for continuously learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies.

In addition to my technical skills, I have also gained valuable experience working with huge Roblox communities, where I have honed my ability to communicate and collaborate with team members and stakeholders. This experience has allowed me to develop strong problem-solving and project management skills, and has prepared me to take on complex programming challenges with confidence and professionalism.

Overall, I am a reliable and dedicated programmer with a proven track record of success. I am excited to bring my skills and expertise to new challenges and am confident in my ability to exceed my clients' expectations.
I've recently created projects such as: 

- [Denblox](https://deno.land/x/denblox): Roblox Api-Wrapper for Deno
